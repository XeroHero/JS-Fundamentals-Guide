# Session 13: JS in Practice - Project tracker website development

Today, we will be looking at making our first website using JavaScript. We have already learnt the basic constructs for designing fully fledged apps such as functions, variables, and data types.

Web browsers are "dumb". They do not natively understand JavaScript and aren't able to work with it as is. It needs to be *called* from a language the browser understands. This is usually HTML (HyperText Markup Language) file.

In web development, you will often hear the terms HTML, CSS and JavaScript (or or some framework derived from it, such as ReactJS or AngularJS) as the basic building blocks for websites.

The table below summarises each language's responsibilty in a typical website.

|Language|Function(s)|
|---|---|
|HTML|Foundations, calls everything else|
|CSS|"Stylesheet", provides styles to the website|
|JS|Makes the website interactive, with dynamic content|
|AJAX|Allows us to interact with databases directly from the website|
