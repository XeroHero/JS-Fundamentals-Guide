# Welcome to JavaScript

This is a course designed for you to learn the fundamentals of JS programming.

## What is JS?

JS (or JavaScript) is a programming language, much like PHP, C and Java. Aside from the name, it shares nothing in common with Java 😂...

It is used mostly in web development, in conjunction with some HTML and CSS (to give us layout and "style" 😎😏)...

It can also be used as a scripting language in some applications, and has many variate uses in industry which we will touch on throughout this course.
